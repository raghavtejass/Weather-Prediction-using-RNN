Abstract
Weather Prediction is notoriously difficult, with numerical methods being the only definitive solution to date, and with large amounts of data to calculate over the duration becomes a challenge. Deep learning strategies have shown an incredible efficiency in predicting periodicity of time series, applying various univariate models based on the Many-to-Many architecture on weather data to contrast long and short-term forecasting between the models for 24 and 72-hour predictions and long term 30 and 60-day predictions, achieving a have achieved an ùëÖ2 score of 0.9 for 24-hour short-term forecasting, 0.85 for long-term 72-hour forecasting. Similarly, we have achieved an ùëÖ2 score of 0.8 for 60-day long term forecasting and 0.9 for 30-day short term forecasting. It can be concluded that this model can be used for forecasting univariate weather data.
